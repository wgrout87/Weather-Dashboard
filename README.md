# Weather Dashboard

This repository contains a webpage for a weather dashboard. A city can be searched for through the text input. Current weather will be displayed, including the temperature, wind speed, humidity, and UV index. A five day forecast will also display with similar information. All information is obtained from OpenWeather.

## Features

* The UV index is color coded depending on severity (green for favorable, yellow for moderate, and red for severe)
* A five day forecast shows the temperature, wind speed, and humidity for the next five days
